# Data Folder

## Overview
This folder contains the dataset used in the Workplace Occupancy Forecasting project. It is organized into two subfolders:

- **`raw/`**: Contains the original dataset in its unprocessed form.
- **`processed/`**: Contains cleaned and preprocessed data for use in modeling.

## Files
1. **`raw/RoomOccupancyPredictionDataset.csv`**: Original dataset with features such as Temperature, Humidity, Light, CO2, and Occupancy.
2. **`processed/processed_data.csv`**: Cleaned dataset after handling missing values and feature engineering.

## Instructions
- Always save the original dataset in the `raw/` folder.
- Use the `processed/` folder to store any transformed or preprocessed data for modeling.
