# Notebooks Folder

## Overview
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for different stages of the Workplace Occupancy Forecasting project. Each notebook focuses on a specific step in the data science workflow.

## Notebooks
1. **`01_data_exploration.ipynb`**:  
   - Load and explore the dataset.  
   - Visualize data trends and identify key patterns.   

3. **`03_modeling.ipynb`**:  
   - Train a Linear Regression model to predict occupancy.  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  
   - Save the trained model to the `models/` folder.  

4. **`04_evaluation.ipynb`**:  
   - Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like MAE and R².  
   - Visualize the actual vs. predicted values.  

## Instructions
- Run each notebook sequentially in the order listed above.  
- Ensure that the processed data is saved to the `data/processed/` folder before moving on to modeling.  
- Save all plots and evaluation results in the `visualizations/` folder.
